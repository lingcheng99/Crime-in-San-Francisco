# Crime-in-San-Francisco

**Data**

The dataset is from the Kaggle competition, San Francisco crime. 

**Data Exploration**

* 'sf_crime_map' for spatial analysis, using R. For drug crimes, tenderloin is the spot. Other crimes are more spread out

* 'sf_crime_time_series' for temporal analysis, using python, answering important questions such as 'do criminals work at night', and 'do criminals work on weekends'.


**Disclaimer** 

R is great for mapping. Python is great for everything else. But simultaneous use of python and R is unpleasant. Hurts your brain.
