# Crime-in-San-Francisco
<br>
The dataset is from Kaggle's San Francisco crime. 
<br>
<br>
'sf_crime_map' for spatial analysis, using ggmap in R. For drug crimes, tenderloin is the spot. Other crimes are more spread out.
<br>
<br>
'sf_crime_time_series' for temporal analysis, using python, answering important questions such as 'do criminals work at night', and 'do criminals work on weekends'.
<br>
<br>
Disclaimer: R is great for mapping. Python is great for everything else. But simultaneous use of python and R is unpleasant. Do it at your own peril.
