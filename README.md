# Map-crime-in-San-Francisco
<br>
The dataset is from Kaggle's San Francisco crime.

For the first step of data exploration, I did mapping in shapefile and sp package, then ggmap. Mapping with ggmap is incredibly easy and the plot is a lot prettier. I also plotted density with stat_density2d in ggmap.
